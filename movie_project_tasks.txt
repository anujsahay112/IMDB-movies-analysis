Tasks:

1. Remove non-movies (filter Type == "movies")
2. Process runtimes into minutes
3. Histogram (distribution) of features (log(features)):
	- runtime
	- budget
	- year
4. Awards - change them to two columns - wins and nominations
5. Genres process into features
6. Plot top 10 genres
7. Correlations
	- runtime vs year
	- Gross vs. Budget
	- Gross vs. Runtime
	- Gross vs. wins (awards)
	- Gross vs. nominations (awards)
	- tomato rating vs. imdb rating
	- ratings vs. wins / nominations
	- budget vs. year
8. Drop rows with missing Gross value
9. Exclude movies released prior to 2000
10. Use any model to predict Gross against only numeric attributes and plot learning curve. Also plot R^2 for each train/test split
11. Improve previous model by transforming your numeric attributes (scaling, boxcox, etc.). Again plot learning curve and R^2
12. Convert at least 3 categorical attributes to binary columns and use these 3 categorical variables in the next model. Again plot learning curve and R^2.
